        Currently different demographics and communities use libraries vastly differently. We wanted to explore reasons
        for these differences and understand how valuable a library is to different communities, or the lack thereof.
        The Pew Research Center conducted surveys from March 7 - April 6 2016 by polling 1601 adults aged 16 and older.
        The questions they asked related to
        technology use, information needs, and Americans’ use of libraries and library resources. From the survey results
        we aimed to identify how different socioeconomic groups and demographic groups utilize these libraries
        and the disparities that arise between them. While there were many findings we wanted to focus on the role that libraries
        played for different income groups and the impact that a library closing would have on a community.

    The above chart reflects what people of different household incomes believe their communities rely on libraries for. People with
    a household income less than $30,000 were most likely to believe that their library contributes “a lot” to helping people find
    jobs or pursue job training as 25% of people in this income bracket said this. On the other hand, people with a household income
    more than $75,000 were the least like two say that their library contributes “a lot” to helping people find jobs or pursue training
    with only 18% believing this. People who are already in higher income brackets are more likely to be able to have a full-time,
    stable job as well as more resources to use for their job search such as personal computers/laptops and also a larger professional
     network.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, as displayed in the figure above, the three income brackets of less than $30,000, $30,000-$49,999, and
    $50,000-$74,999 were all equally likely to think that their public library contributes “a lot” in terms of helping people when
    they see health information with 36% saying this in each income bracket. However, only 24% of people with a household income of
     more than $75,000 believed the library contributed a lot in regards to getting health information. The people who are in
     significantly higher income brackets are more likely to have health insurance and also be able to afford any costs associated
     with medical visits and treatments. However people who do not have as high of a household income can not afford unexpected
     health related costs so they are more likely to rely on public resources like the library to find information about their health
     issues and find ways to minimize costs associated with it.

  <p>As shown in the above graph, people who have a household income of less than $30,000 were the most likely to say that a library
    closing would have a major impact on their community with 41% of respondents in this income bracket saying that. This income
    bracket was also the one that was most likely to say that their community relies a lot on the library to find jobs or pursue job
    training so with this particular group could potentially find their community suffering from an expanding socioeconomic gap from
    people in high income brackets.  It is also important to see that older people, especially 40% of those in the age range from 50-64 stated that a closed library
    would have a major impact on their community. Especially during COVID-19 when libraries are closed, this presents a difficult problem
    to people in that age range as it is hard for them to adopt new technologies which could give them the information that libraries do.
    Without access to a library, people may be unable to find as wide of a variety of jobs and could
    be missing out on better opportunities because they are no longer accessible to them without the resource of a library. This would
    also likely have an effect on the overall health of people with lower incomes in the community because many of them reported that
    the library is a community that is used "a lot" to seek out health-related information. If the public library were closed, this
    people would be cut off from access to resources that allow them to find adequate medical attention that they can afford. This
    would likely result in a lack of seeking medical attention, hurting the health of the community, or force low-income households
    to go into debt as a result of high, unexpected medical fees. </p>

<div class="text">
    <p>Furthermore, in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, libraries have been forced to limit in-person services. This has particularly 
        affected communities such as High Point, North Carolina, where the public library has been a predominant resource for 
        addressing food insecurity, but “COVID-19 has made the situation even worse.”  Without the resource of a public library, 
        lower income communities could face increased issues with accessibility. Additionally, libraries have been able to provide 
        support to their communities during the pandemic by providing resources for remote education. Hawkeye Community College 
        Library in Iowa reported that they “checked out 143 laptops to students needing devices to do work online” which “helped 
        some students persist who may not have in this new learning environment.” Libraries have provided critical support for 
        communities that do not have as many resources as others both before and during the pandemic. Without the public resource
         of libraries, lower income communities would be forced to lose access to resources that are more widely-available in higher
          income communities, thus creating an even greater gap in accessibility and overall community health between socioeconomic 
          classes.  </p>
